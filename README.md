 PL/SQL Window Functions - Customer Loyalty Analysis

## Business Problem Definition

**Business Context:** A coffee and beverage retail company operating across multiple regions (Europe, East Africa, Asia) needs to analyze customer purchasing patterns and product performance to optimize their loyalty program and marketing strategies.

**Data Challenge:** The company struggles to identify high-value customers, understand regional product preferences, and track sales trends over time. Management needs data-driven insights to segment customers effectively and allocate marketing resources efficiently.

**Expected Outcome:** Implement analytical queries using window functions to identify top-performing products per region, calculate running sales totals, analyze month-over-month growth patterns, segment customers into quartiles for targeted marketing, and smooth sales trends using moving averages.

## Success Criteria

1. **Top 5 Products Per Region** → Using RANK() to identify best-selling products by region
2. **Running Monthly Sales Totals** → Using SUM() OVER() to track cumulative revenue
3. **Month-over-Month Growth Analysis** → Using LAG()/LEAD() to calculate growth percentages
4. **Customer Quartile Segmentation** → Using NTILE(4) to divide customers into spending tiers
5. **3-Month Moving Averages** → Using AVG() OVER() with frame specifications for trend analysis

Window Functions Implementation

 1. Ranking Functions 

Query: Top Products by Region
sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT 
        region,
        p.name AS product_name,
        SUM(t.amount) AS total_sales,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY SUM(t.amount) DESC) AS rank_in_region
    FROM transactions t
    JOIN customers c ON t.customer_id = c.customer_id
    JOIN products p ON t.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY region, p.name
) ranked_products
WHERE rank_in_region <= 5;


Results:

Interpretation: Arabica Beans dominate sales across all regions, indicating strong customer preference for premium coffee. Europe shows higher total sales volume and 

product diversity compared to East Africa, suggesting a more mature market with varied product adoption.

 2. Aggregate Window Functions (Image 1)

Query: Running Monthly Sales Totals
sql
   SELECT 
   
    DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m') AS sale_months
    SUM(amount) AS monthly_sales,
    SUM(SUM(amount)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m')) AS running_total
FROM transactions
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m');



Results:
<img width="776" height="381" alt="photo 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f3da0fd-54e5-456c-a21e-21117daf7ada" />


Interpretation:The running total demonstrates cumulative revenue growth reaching 118,500.00 by April 2025. Notable sales spike in January (50,000) followed by a decline in February and recovery in March, with April showing significantly lower sales that warrant investigation.

 3. Navigation Functions 

Query: Month-over-Month Growth Analysis
sql
WITH monthly_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m') AS sale_month,
        SUM(amount) AS total_sales
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m')
)
SELECT 
    sale_month,
    total_sales,
    LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY sale_month) AS prev_month,
    ROUND((total_sales - LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY sale_month)) / 
          NULLIF(LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY sale_month), 0) * 100, 2) AS growth_pct
FROM monthly_sales;


Results:
<img width="774" height="394" alt="photo 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0883b9c-7fcd-4580-b1e5-d43da031594e" />

         

Interpretation: The business shows high volatility with a dramatic 55% drop in February, strong 77.78% recovery in March, but concerning 85% collapse in April. This pattern suggests seasonal fluctuations or operational issues requiring immediate management attention.

4. Distribution Functions 

Query: Customer Spending Quartiles
  sql
       SELECT 
         customer_id,
         SUM(amount) AS total_spent,
         NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC) AS spending_quartile
     FROM transactions
     GROUP BY customer_id;


Results:
<img width="774" height="317" alt="photo 4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/764a6408-4351-4c72-86b3-b32664729353" />



Interpretation: Customer segmentation reveals significant spending disparity. Customer 1 (56,000) represents the premium segment suitable for VIP treatment. Customer 3 (40,000) shows medium-value potential for upselling. Customer 2 (22,500) requires engagement strategies to increase purchase frequency and order value.

 5. Moving Averages 

Query: 3-Month Moving Average
sql
WITH monthly_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m') AS sale_month,
        SUM(amount) AS total_sales
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m')
)
SELECT 
    sale_month,
    total_sales,
    ROUND(AVG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY sale_month ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW), 2) AS moving_avg_3m
FROM monthly_sales;


Results:
<img width="779" height="416" alt="photo 5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff88c2ef-f80a-46d8-8756-28ec46698e6e" />


Interpretation: The moving average smooths out monthly volatility, revealing an underlying downward trend from 37,500 in March to 22,833 in April. This trend-smoothing technique helps identify that recent performance decline is not just a single-month anomaly but part of a concerning pattern.

Results Analysis

Descriptive Analysis (What Happened?)
Sales Patterns:
- Total revenue through April 2025: 118,500.00
- Peak performance in January (50,000) followed by significant fluctuations
- April represents the weakest month with only 6,000 in sales
- Arabica Beans consistently lead product sales across regions

Customer Behavior:
- Clear three-tier customer segmentation with 2.5x spending gap between top and bottom
- Geographic concentration in Europe and East Africa
- Customer 1 contributes 47% of total revenue (high concentration risk)

Product Performance:
- Beverages category (Arabica Beans, Robusta Blend) drives 85% of revenue
- Merchandise (Coffee Mug) shows lower adoption but represents diversification opportunity
- Regional preferences show consistency, with premium products preferred

 Diagnostic Analysis (Why Did It Happen?)

Volatility Drivers:
- 85% April decline likely indicates seasonal downturn or supply chain disruption
- February's 55% drop may correlate with post-holiday spending fatigue
- Limited customer base (4 customers) creates high vulnerability to individual purchase patterns

Regional Dynamics:
- Europe's higher sales suggest better market penetration and established distribution
- East Africa's single-product focus (Arabica Beans) indicates early market stage or limited product awareness
- Asia shows no sales activity in current data, representing untapped potential

Customer Concentration:
- Heavy reliance on Customer 1 creates business continuity risk
- Bottom-tier customer (Customer 2) has potential for 2-3x growth to match peers
- Loyalty program structure (Gold, Silver, Platinum) not correlating with actual spending patterns

Prescriptive Analysis (What Should We Do?)

Immediate Actions:
1. Address April Crisis: Investigate root cause of 85% sales drop (supply issues, competition, customer churn) and implement recovery plan within 2 weeks
2. Diversify Customer Base: Launch acquisition campaign to reduce dependency on Customer 1 from 47% to under 30% of revenue
3. Optimize Loyalty Program: Realign loyalty tiers to match actual spending quartiles, offering Customer 1 premium benefits to ensure retention

Strategic Initiatives
1. Geographic Expansion: Activate Asia region with targeted product launches based on East Africa/Europe success patterns
2. Product Portfolio: Expand merchandise line leveraging Coffee Mug's 6,000 performance as baseline; introduce complementary products
3. Seasonal Planning: Develop promotional calendar addressing identified February and April weak periods with bundled offers or campaigns

Operational Improvements:
1. **Enhanced Analytics:** Implement real-time dashboards using these window functions to detect anomalies within 72 hours instead of month-end
2. **Customer Engagement:** Create tiered marketing automation for quartile segments with personalized offers (10% for bottom tier, exclusive access for top)
3. **Regional Strategy:** Deploy product education in East Africa to diversify beyond Arabica Beans; replicate Europe's multi-product success


## Technical Quality

- All queries execute successfully with response times under 1 millisecond
- Proper use of CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for query organization
- Appropriate handling of NULL values in LAG/LEAD calculations using NULLIF
- Efficient use of PARTITION BY for region-based analysis
- Consistent date formatting using DATE_FORMAT function
- Foreign key constraints properly implemented maintaining referential integrity
